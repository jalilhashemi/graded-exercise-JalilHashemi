In home page there are two buttons:
Teacher and Student
+ Student button has functions
    + If there is no question created then the button has another function and takes you to another page
    + If there is a question then it would lead you to the multiple choice page
+ Teacher button will lead you to the page where one as a teacher has the possibility to either create a question or to see the report (the ruslt of multiple choice)
 but it no student has chosen any answer yet then the button would be deactivated

I'm particular proud of:
