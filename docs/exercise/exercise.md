In home page there are two buttons:
Teacher and Student
+ Student button has a function
    + If there is no question created then the button has another function and takes you to another page
    + If there is a question then it would lead you to the multiple choice page
+ Teacher button will lead you to the page where one as a teacher has the possibility to either create a question or 
to see the report (the ruslt of multiple choice)
 but it no student has chosen any answer yet then the button would be deactivated
 
Although it was much easier to create my own views, I preferred to use and find out how the created grail's views work. 
Of course it took me longer to find out the connections and their relations and how they work with one anther

For this project I have tried to keep the application as simple as possible. For this purpose I could reach an easy 
application which gives a teacher the possibility to create his question and its answers with **just 3 clicks** and 
he can have as many answer as he want. **there no limitaion**

I'm particular proud of:

I may not be able to use the grail environment properly but doing this project has given a very good self confidence
and has proven to me that I at least can do something :)
I thank you for giving us the opportunity to work and learn something new! 
I am proud of what we have learn and have done
